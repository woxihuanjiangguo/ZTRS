# Dataset splits vs. filtered training / test splits

The NAVSIM framework utilizes several dataset splits for standardized training and evaluating agents.
All of them use the OpenScene dataset that is divided into the dataset splits `mini`, `trainval`,` test`, which can all be downloaded separately.

It is possible to run trainings and evaluations directly on these sets (see `OpenScene` in table below).
Alternatively, you can run trainings and evaluations on training and validation splits that were filtered for challenging scenarios (see `NAVSIM` in table below), which is the recommended option for producing comparable and competitive results efficiently.
In contrast to the dataset splits which refer to a downloadable set of logs, the training / test splits are implemented as scene filters, which define how scenes are extracted from these logs.

The NAVSIM training / test splits subsample the OpenScene dataset splits.
Moreover, the NAVSIM splits include overlapping scenes, while the Standard splits are non-overlapping.
Specifically, `navtrain` is based on the `trainval` data and `navtest` and `navhard_two_stage` on the `test` data.

As the `trainval` sensor data is very large, we provide a separate download link, which loads only the frames needed for `navtrain`.
This eases access for users that only want to run the `navtrain` split and not the `trainval` split. If you already downloaded the full `trainval` sensor data, it is **not necessary** to download the `navtrain` frames as well.
The logs are always the complete dataset split.

## Splits

The standard splits `trainval`, `test`, and `mini` are from the OpenScene dataset. Note that the data corresponds to the nuPlan dataset with a lower frequency of 2Hz. You can download all standard splits over Hugging Face with the bash scripts in [download](../download)

NAVSIM provides a subset and filter of the `trainval` split, called `navtrain`. The `navtrain` split facilitates a standardized training scheme and requires significantly less sensor data storage than `travel` (445GB vs. 2100GB). If your agents don't need historical sensor inputs, you can download `navtrain` without history, which requires 300GB of storage. Note that the sensor data for `navtrain` can be downloaded separately via <a href="https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim/blob/main/download/download_navtrain_aws.sh">download_navtrain_aws.sh</a> or <a href="https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim/blob/main/download/download_navtrain_hf.sh">download_navtrain_hf.sh</a> but it still requires access to the `trainval` logs.

The `navtest` split enables a standardized set for testing agents in NAVSIM v1 with a provided scene filter. Similarly, the `navhard_two_stage` split split facilitates pseudo closed-loop simulation for evaluation in NAVSIM v2. `navtrain`, `navtest` and `navhard_two_stage` are filtered to increase interesting samples in the sets.

For the challenge on Hugging Face, we provide the `warmup_two_stage` and `private_test_hard_two_stage` for the warm-up and challenge track, respectively. Using the `test`/`navtest`/`navhard_two_stage`/`warmup_two_stage`/`private_test_two_stage` splits for training your challenge submissions is not allowed. Using any other publicly available datasets or pretrained weights is allowed. Furthermore, to be eligible for awards, the use of data must be described explicitly in the technical report for your submission.

## Troubleshooting

As previous users reported missing files when downloading `navtrain`, we provide MD5 checksums for the `.tgz` files to identify corrupted downloads. We recommend to re-download `navtrain` without deleting the `.tgz` files (i.e. removing Line 12 and 22 in [download_navtrain_aws.sh](https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim/blob/main/download/download_navtrain_aws.sh)) and running:

```bash
echo "6f92f38d5f03ed852da7872a7122bdd2  navtrain_current_1.tgz" | md5sum -c -
echo "7a72f0a758b5df6cbe4c565920a4869f  navtrain_current_2.tgz" | md5sum -c -
